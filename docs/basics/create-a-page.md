## Create your first Page

To create a page, you must configure its **Page Type**, **Template** and give it a **Slug**.

### Page Type & Templates

Page types are used to group custom designed Templates. A Template gives your page a header and content section that can be changed using Whppt's editing tools.

### Basic Page Types and headers

Your site will come with the following Page types and Templates, along with custom options:

### Generic Page Type

This page type groups common page templates for your website that can be used from the homepage, to the about page, new campaigns and branding.

#### Home Template 

The Home page template is already created for you and available at the root of your site.

  - Generic Template ()
  - Contact Template
- News Page Type (creates a new article page that will be listed in /news)

### Page Slug

The **slug** is the url path users will see when they visit your page. Slugs can be nested with a forward slash / to help structure your web pages.

Slugs are made URL friendly by Whppt, this will switch any spaces to hyphens, remove any uppercase characters and strip out characters that are not URL safe.

### Finish

When you are happy with your Template and Slug configuration, click the **Create Page** button and you will be directed to your new page.
