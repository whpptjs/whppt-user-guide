## Create your first Page

To create a page, you must configure its **page type**, **template** and give it a **slug**.

### Page Type & Templates

Page types are used to group custom designed templates based on their purposes. Selecting a **type** will allow you to select a corresponding **template**

By selecting a **template**, your page will have a **header** and a **content section** that can be changed using Whppt's editing tools.

If there is only one **template** available under a certain **page type**, it will be automatically selected for you.

### Basic Page Types and Templates

Your site will come with the following page types and templates, along with custom options:

- #### Generic Page Type

This page type groups common page templates for your website that can be used from the _homepage_, to the _about_ page, new _campaigns_ and _branding_.

- #### Generic Page Type - Home Template

  This template is already created for you and suitable for using at the root of your site. It is also available to be applied to any page.

- #### Generic Page Type - Generic Template

  - Contact template: Could be used for pages that hold address, contact details and other information of your business.

  - Other custom made templates that are of general usage

- #### News Page Type (News Page Template)

  This page type and the matching template creates a new article page that will be listed under the URL `/news` to showcase the newest steps of your business.

### Page Slug

The **slug** is the url path users will see when they visit your page. Slugs can be nested with a forward slash `/` to help structure your web pages.

Slugs are made URL friendly by Whppt:

- First _forward slash_ `/` is optional
- Any _spaces_ <code>&nbsp;</code> are switched to _hyphens_ `-`
- _uppercase characters_ and characters that are not URL safe are stripped out (for example, `*`, `&`, `?` and etc.).

The converted URL will be shown below as follows.

### Finish

When you are happy with your page, template and slug configuration, click the **Create Page** button, and Whppt will check if the slug is unique, then direct you to your new page.
