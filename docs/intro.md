# Introduction

Welcome to Whppt!

Whppt is an open source, interactive CMS for your website and suite of tools that make website management and customisations quick and easy. Instead of going through pages of backend content management screens to make changes, Whppt's toolbar allows you to edit content that you see directly on the page.

## Getting Started

Visit your Whppt website's draft domain and you'll find a login button that allows you to securely log into whppt with your provided whppt username and login.
